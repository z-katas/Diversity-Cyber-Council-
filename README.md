## Platform Roadmap
There are several factors which affect the success of any new business or green field project.
* Viability of the idea - Are there any buyers for the idea?
* Funding - Are there any investors for the idea? 
* Time - An idea may be viable but it may take a long time to develop. And an idea which is viable today may not be that attractive after certain period of time.
