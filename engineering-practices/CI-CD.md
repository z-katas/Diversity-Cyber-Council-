## Continuous Integration Practices

* Linting and format checks for code consistency.
* Code should be built ensuring no static and compile-time errors.
* Unit tested to ensure there are no functional bugs.
* Code quality checks to ensure bad code stays away from the main branch.

## Continuous Deployment Practices

* Code ships automatically when merged to the main branch
