# Data compliance and security

The system deals with PII data(emails, contact details) which are sensitive. Compliance and security become a core part of the data requirements.  

## Measures to be followed

* Store no PII data in our system and store them entirely in a 3rd party system that is compliant. 
* If the system needs to store any such information, use a data-compliant database and cloud provider.
* Encrypt the data at rest and transit.
* Ensure regular security scans and alerts in the system.
