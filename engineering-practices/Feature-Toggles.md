# Feature Toggles(Feature flags)

It is a technique that turns a functionality on/off at runtime. This toggle does not need code changes and deployment, giving code owners more control and flexibility to iterate.

## Benefits:

* A/B testing 
* Production testing
* Canary Release
* Rollback switch
* Trunk based deployment
* Cross service switches - One switch toggles the feature for all the services
